## Note: I plan to release 1.0 by mid Apr, holding on merging any new pull requests to master until that is complete.

A dark colored UI theme for Atom with custom file icons. [Seti Syntax](https://atom.io/themes/seti-syntax) also available.

##### Note: Keep an eye out for 1.0 coming _very_ soon with some big updates. You can keep an eye on the [1.0-beta branch](https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-ui/tree/1.0-beta) if you'd like to follow the progress.
